# ðŸŒž Solar Potential Utilization in Swiss Municipalities  
*An Analytical Look at Solar Power Usage Across Switzerland (2021â€“2023)*

---

## ðŸ“˜ Background & Overview

Switzerland has made strong commitments toward sustainable energy, with **solar power positioned as a key pillar** of the national energy transition. Each municipality has a defined solar potential based on:

- Rooftop availability  
- Building orientation  
- Local climate conditions  

Yet, **actual utilization varies widely**.

This project analyzes the extent to which municipalities are utilizing their available solar capacity between **March 2021 and March 2023**. We examine:

- Growth trends over time  
- Leading and lagging municipalities  
- Recommendations to unlock unused capacity  

ðŸ“Š The data is sourced from [Energie Reporter](https://opendata.swiss/en/dataset/energie-reporter) and reflects **monthly progress in solar power installation and potential usage** at the municipality level.

## ðŸ§± Data Structure Overview

The analysis is based on the **historicized municipality dataset**, which includes:

| Column                         | Description                                               |
