tgleich# ‚òÄÔ∏è Swiss Solar Adoption: Are We Fully Tapping Municipal Potential?

## üìå Project Background

Switzerland is ramping up its solar investments to meet national energy and climate goals ‚Äî but **are all municipalities equally effective in utilizing their solar potential**?

This project uses granular data from the [**Energie Reporter**](https://opendata.swiss/en/dataset/energie-reporter) to assess:
- üìà How much solar capacity is installed vs. actually used  
- üó∫Ô∏è Regional disparities in adoption across municipalities and cantons  
- üöß Where inefficiencies and untapped opportunities exist  

The insights are designed to support:
- **Federal and cantonal energy agencies**  
- **Local governments and infrastructure planners**  
- **Environmental policymakers and NGOs**

The core objective is to pinpoint **underperforming areas** and explain *why* solar usage lags ‚Äî despite available infrastructure ‚Äî across Switzerland‚Äôs 2,000+ municipalities over a 3-year period.

## üß† Executive Summary

As of **March 2024**:

- üå§Ô∏è **National average solar usage is 7% (as of March 2024)**, rising from 4.3% in 2021.
- üèòÔ∏è **289 out of 2184 municipalities (13.2%) use less than 5% of their solar potential**, even with installed infrastructure.
- üèÖ **Top-performing municipalities** exceed 40% usage, often clustered within certain cantons like Ticino (TI), and Vaud (VD).
- üîç Despite having the highest levels of installed solar capacity, major Swiss cities like Z√ºrich, Bern, and Lausanne are utilizing less than 5% of their solar potential.
- üìà If current trends hold, national usage is projected to reach **~10% by mid-2025**.

## üìä Insights Deep Dive

### 1. üîù Adoption Leaders and Laggards
- Histogram reveals a **long tail**: most municipalities are underperforming.
- Leading municipalities like Onnens (VD) and Clarmont (VD) have solar potential usage rates over 6√ó the national average.
- The national average stands at 6.7%, while the top municipality exceeds 40% ‚Äî highlighting significant geographic disparities.
- Most others are still far below the national average ‚Äî signaling room for growth and replication of best practices.
- If more municipalities matched even the mid-tier performers, national solar usage could grow substantially.
- Municipalities in similar cantons (e.g., VD and FR) show variable performance, indicating that policy, not geography, may be the key driver.
- Outperformers often share regional or infrastructure characteristics.

### 2. ‚öñÔ∏è Installed Capacity ‚â† Usage
- There's no strong linear correlation between installed capacity (kWp) and actual usage (%).
- Some municipalities with very high capacity (>10,000 kWp) still have very low usage (<10%), indicating underutilization.
- There‚Äôs a dense cluster of municipalities with moderate capacity and low usage (bottom-right quadrant).This suggests structural inefficiencies or policy/implementation issues.
- High-capacity, low-usage municipalities may have invested in infrastructure without ensuring uptake, integration, or behavior change.
- Municipalities with low installed capacity but high usage (Curio, Astano) are potentially model cases of efficiency. These municipalities make the most out of limited resources ‚Äî ideal for best practice case studies.
- As installed capacity increases beyond a threshold (e.g., 15k‚Äì20k kWp), usage stagnates or drops. This may imply scale-related inefficiencies, lack of grid integration, or oversizing without uptake.
- Darker shades (pink/purple) indicate extreme inefficiency ‚Äî useful to pinpoint which municipalities to audit or support.
- Color distribution also shows inefficiency is widespread across cantons, not just isolated.
- Cantons BE and AG appear to have a disproportionately high number of municipalities with underutilized solar capacity ‚Äî indicating regional opportunity for better solar adoption initiatives or more efficient usage.
- Upper-right quadrant (high capacity & high usage) is nearly empty, suggesting very few municipalities are both scaling and utilizing effectively.
- Lower-left quadrant is densely populated ‚Äî showing a long tail of low-capacity, low-usage municipalities, which may represent areas with either limited funding or weak policy engagement.
- Opportunity zone: Mid-capacity + mid-usage municipalities might be the most scalable targets ‚Äî they have infrastructure and moderate performance, suggesting room for improvement.
- High Capacity + Low Usage = "Underperformers": Z√ºrich, Bern, Lausanne, Basel, Bellinzona
- Low Capacity + High Usage = "Efficiency Champions": Curio, Astano, Rovray, Clarmont
- High Capacity + High Usage = "Model Scalers": No
- Low Capacity + Low Usage = "Neglected Zone": Auboranges, Andermatt, Saxeten.
- At very high installed capacity (>25kW or >40kW), solar usage plateaus or drops. This is critical for national investment planning: don‚Äôt just install more; ensure it's used well.

### 3. üìà Growth Trends Over Time
- Switzerland has shown steady solar potential usage growth over the past 3 years, with an overall upward trend despite volatility in specific months.
- While growth rates vary from month to month, a positive long-term trajectory is evident, as confirmed by the trend line.
- There are occasional dips, such as in April 2023 (-12.8%) and February 2022 (-4.9%), but these are not due to missing data or reporting inconsistencies.
- Python analysis confirms that the number of municipalities reporting data remains stable across all months ‚Äî so dips reflect real-world slowdowns, not data gaps.
- These declines are likely due to seasonal effects (e.g., winter months, weather-related installation delays), grid integration timing, or behavioral/policy lags.
- After dips, recovery is often strong, suggesting a resilient and growing solar adoption landscape.
- The average monthly growth rate sits around 2‚Äì3%, indicating a modest but sustained national expansion.

### 5. üó∫Ô∏è Regional Disparities
- In both actual and projected data, there's a clear usage gap between leading and lagging cantons.
- Leading cantons like AI, AR, LU, SG consistently show higher-than-average usage.
- Lagging cantons ‚Äî UR, VS, GE, GR ‚Äî remain below the national average even in projections.
- While the national average increases from ~7.2% (actual) to ~11.0% (projected), not all cantons benefit equally: Some low-performing cantons improve slightly but remain at the bottom. AI jumps to the top in projected data, suggesting strong policy or adoption plans.
- Surprisingly, rural cantons (e.g., AI, AR, LU) outperform urban-heavy ones (e.g., ZH, GE, TI), indicating that urbanization isn‚Äôt a driver of solar efficiency. This hints at better engagement, adoption, or policy execution in smaller/rural cantons.
- Some cantons with large installed capacities (e.g., BE, GE) still rank low in actual usage, suggesting underutilization of infrastructure. This reinforces earlier scatterplot findings about inefficiencies at scale.
- Cantons with both low actual and projected usage may need targeted intervention, such as: Local incentive redesign, infrastructure integration support, public engagement or behavior chnage campaigns.

## üìå Recommendations

1. **Target Underperforming Municipalities**  
   Focus incentives or education programs where capacity is high, but usage is low.

2. **Replicate Best Practices**  
   Study top-performing municipalities to replicate success in similar regions.

3. **Monitor Usage, Not Just Capacity**  
   Set performance goals based on actual utilization, not just installations.

4. **Enable Self-Service Benchmarking**  
   Build dashboards for municipalities to compare performance and track progress.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats & Assumptions

- `solar_potential_usage` is calculated as a basic ratio ‚Äî does not account for weather, shading, or roof orientation.
- Forecasts are based on historical exponential smoothing, **not ML**.
- **No demographic or economic data** included in this version.
- Some solar capacity installation timestamps may lag actual project completion.
- **Data Cutoff**: Values after March¬†2024 were excluded as projections. Our analysis focuses on actual data through March¬†2023.
- **Outliers**: One record (Chapelle (Gl√¢ne)) reported >100% usage; this was capped at 100% for visualization.
- **Projected Data**: Entries beyond last update (Mar¬†2024) likely represent forecasts or estimates‚Äînot measured values.
- **Temporal Gaps**: Use of rolling averages causes minor delays in trend lines immediately after cutoffs.
- **Municipality Aggregation**: National trends sum municipalities assuming no overlaps.
- **No External Validation**: Data taken at face value without cross‚Äëreferencing federal statistics.
